<p>
  The project was created, but it uses an older version of Angular, version 16.
  However, this is a great opportunity to learn how to migrate Angular versions.
  I don't recommend manually changing the version in the "package.json" file.
  Instead, visit the website https://angular.dev/update-guide.

<p>
  By specifying the desired version there, you will find the migration commands and necessary changes.
  For example:
</p>

<p style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: flex-start;  align-items: start;">
  <img src="/docu-data/images/update-guide-1.png" width="400" alt="" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0.5rem;"/>
  <img src="/docu-data/images/update-guide-2.png" width="400" alt="" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0.5rem;"/>
</p>
