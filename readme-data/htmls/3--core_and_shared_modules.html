  <h5> Core Module </h5>

  <p>
    The core module in Angular is typically used to house essential services that provide global functionalities
    throughout the application.
    It includes:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Services: </span> Services that offer global functions, such as authentication, logging, data handling, and more.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">HTTP Interceptors: </span> Interceptors for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses across the application.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Models: </span> Shared data models used by various components and services.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Guards: </span> Route guards that protect routes and provide permissions based on conditions like user authentication.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5> Shared Module </h5>

  <p>
    The shared module in Angular is designed to store components, directives, pipes,
    and other resources that can be used across different parts of the application, promoting code reusability
    and reducing duplication.
    It typically includes:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shared Components:</span> Components used in various parts of the application, such as buttons, modals, forms, etc.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shared Directives: </span> Directives that add additional functionality to HTML elements,
      such as form validation directives, animations, etc.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shared Pipes: </span> Pipes that format data for display in different parts of the application.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Core and shared modules in Angular help structure and organize application code, making it more maintainable,
    scalable, and reusable. These modules contribute to improved application architecture and reduced
    coupling between different parts of the application.
